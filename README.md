# RainFall Analysis

Using visuliaztion packages I have created effective visuals that can help to describe the data.

<h1>Key Concepts:
  
Use Pandas to produce a table to visualize the data. 
Produce a data plot using MatPlotLib Pyplot. Use Seaborn to create a scatterplot graph. 
Create a Jointplot to show distribution. 
Create a heatmap to show correlations and distributions
